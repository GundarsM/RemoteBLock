# RemoteBlocker
## Contraption to hold remote unless a memory game is won

Built as a part of 1 month design challenge in course "Creative Engineering with Mark Rober"
Build took around 5 days. 3 days for mechanics and electronics and 2 days took programming

Habit I want to improve - **less time watching TV**

There are still some **bugs** - the sequence game sometimes skips reading pressed button and pattern game sometimes

**Demonstration** can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzOo9EEi5eQ&t=1s) 

**Further improvements:**
- Fixtures holding remote are mowing (user doesn't need to move them)
- Larger screen, possibly some screen games
- Improved mechanics/design
- Fixing in game bugs
- Implementing one "cheat day" function
